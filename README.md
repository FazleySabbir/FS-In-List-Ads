# FS-In-List-Ads
Hello Guys,

This is Fazley Sabbir.I am very happy to announce that my first plugin is out now.It is my first complete PHP project.So if you find any bug, let me know and I will debug it as soon as possible.

However, Now I am talking about the plugin - In List Ads.You can show your ads in the list of questions.There's an option in the admin area which will let you to define after how many questions your ads should be shown.Also you can place an credit of your site above the ads.

UPDATE 1.1: Thanks to ghaplaman for giving me the idea.As the latest version, you can show your ads on specific page or on every page as you like.Also this plugin is able to show ads on the pages that use q_list functions.
UPDATE 1.3 has been released now.
